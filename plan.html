<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Attract more younger people to  the Cosplay Parties</li>
  <li>More sales (online and in store  sales) of second hand and homemade costumes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mission  Statement (Planning)</h2>
<p><strong>Our aim is to include younger  cosplayers in parties, and to increase sales</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Too short</li>
  <li>Not enough details</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our goals here at CossiePlay is  to get young people into the art of Cosplay, expand their social skills through  parties and to increase our sales of home made and second hand costumes.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Too long?</li>
  <li>Good detail this time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At CossiePlay, we want to get the  young people in the community involved in Cosplay both with parties and with  dressing up, and to increase our sales on costumes.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Good length</li>
  <li>Still not enough detail.     </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our goals at CossiePlay is to  increase the number of young people involved with Cosplay, to include them in  parties and to increase our sales of costumes.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Good length</li>
  <li>Enough detail? </li>

<h2>Mission  Statement</h2>
<p>Our goals at CossiePlay is to increase the number of people involved with  and aware of Cosplay, to include more young people in parties and to increase  our sales of homemade and second hand costumes.</p>
<h2>Success  Evaluation</h2>
<p>The mission statement will be considered a success if the average age of  a Cosplay party goer becomes anywhere between 13-30; if the community becomes  more aware of Cosplay, whether that be through expressions of interest, questions  or more visitors to parties; and if sales of both homemade and second-hand  costumes increases.</p>
<h2>Target  Audience</h2>
<p>There are two target audiences mentioned in the Client Content &amp;  Information; however one is more clearly stressed than the other. The first is  the community as a whole; this Target Audience is not the primary objective. The  second is young people, specifically high school kids and young adults. This  Target Audience appears to be the main objective of CossiePlay, and so the  website will be created accordingly.</p>
<p>To appeal to a younger audience, the website should be eye catching, both  in the site&rsquo;s information architecture and in its colour scheme, pictures etc.  It should have helpful parts such as the &ldquo;no more than three clicks&rdquo; rule applied  to links, or a click to the top of page button. Website does not need to cater  for users that will get easily lost, and time used for this will be spared.</p>
